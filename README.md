# BRAINWASH

## Introduction
---
Over the last few years, while working through the pandemic, weâ€™ve been spending a lot more time at home and people have turned to social media to stay connected with others to fill that extra time.

As we know, many of the popular social media platforms, like Instagram and TikTok, have been proven to be quite detrimental to our mental health, so we wanted to create a platform which would foster a healthier online community where people can connect with one another in a social context, all while consuming more positive content.

Users come to Brainwash to learn new skills, improve existing passions, and share their own knowledge through various media types with an online community of other passionate lifelong learners - think of Brainwash as Master Class meets Instagram & Youtube.

Brainwash is our submission for the final project for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp. Over an enjoyable 10 days, the creators: Russell Engebretson, Sophie Oliver and Katie Herda, worked together to build out an MVP of the platform, expanding on knowledge learned in the bootcamp, to add functionality that would allow users to create and consume content, and communicate with other Brainwashers.

## Live Server

## Repository
---
This is the front end repository for our app, if you would like to view the backend API click [Brainwash-API](https://github.com/sjoliver/brainwash-ify-ology-api)

We built the frontend with React, utilizing React Router to mimic a multi-page application.

With the short 10 day timeline for producing the platform, we wanted to go with a simple and clean UI. We accomplished this in part by implementing Material UI components. 

For user authentication, we integrated Auth0 using oAuth 2.0 which enabled users to access their accounts with their social logins. Auth0 implementation enabled us to build a login/logout feature without having to deal with security issues associated with handling user data properly. It also removes the need for users to remember yet another username and password combo. 

We are very proud of the work that went into this application with the limited time we were given, but some of the key improvements we would like to complete are as follows:

- Re-organize state to allow the app to run more efficiently (ex. limit the number of backend axios API calls, boosting efficiency and overall user experience)
- Incorporating context and/or redux to manage state more effectively
- Update some UI elements -> ex. introducing a separate "save" feature instead of utilizing the likes feature (you should be able to like a post but not be interested in learning it) 
- Implement an in-app chat/inbox feature so user's can connect privately 
- Implement post annotations so user's can create & share their notes 

## Project Layout
---
This application was laid out following some best practices while using React. In the src directory you will find a [component directory](https://github.com/sjoliver/brainwash-ify-ology/tree/main/src/components) which houses all of our react components which are fed to the App.js file located in the root of the src directory.

# Running the Repo locally for development
---
create a .env file with a single component in it
```js
  PORT=3002
```

This is to avoid conflicts with the rails backend API running on port 3000, React's default.

run the following commands in your terminal: 
```js
npm install
npm start
```
The server should start on localhost port 3002.
